## Class 1

#### [Password Security, A Case History](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.128.1635&rep=rep1&type=pdf), by Robert Morris (Sr.) and Ken Thompson
We will discuss only the experiment and resulting recommendations on the third page. However, since the entire paper is only four pages and was the definitive work on passwords for decades following its publication in 1979, we encourage (but do not require) students to read the full paper.

Expect us to discuss the impacts of the advice in this paper and its influence on future research.

_Historical Notes_: [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson) won the ACM Turing Award for the "development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system".  [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_(cryptographer)) contributed to UNIX and later became Chief Scientist of the National Security Agency's National Computer Security Center. He was also the father of MIT's Professor Robert T. Morris.

#### [Why Johnny Can’t Encrypt: A Usability Evaluation of PGP 5.0](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.40.9279&rep=rep1&type=pdf), by Alma Whitten and J. Doug Tygar
Rather than submitting this paper to the top HCI conference (ACM SIGCHI), Whitten and Tygar got it accepted to a top single-track Computer Security conference (USENIX Security).  Expect us to discuss that choice after we finish talking about the content of the paper.

_Historical Notes_: Alma Whitten joined Google not long after the publication of this seminal paper, where she would lead the Application Security (AppSec) team and then becoming Director of Privacy for three years stepping down in 2013. This is why she disappears from the research literature and her dissertation (_Making Security Usable_) wasn't completed until 2004.

## Class 2

#### [Design Principles and Patterns for Computer Systems That Are Simultaneously Secure and Usable](https://simson.net/thesis/), Simson Garfinkel's PhD Thesis
ASSIGNED ONLY Chapter 1.1–1.5, pp. 13–30, and Chapter 10.3 Patterns for Overall Security.

_Note_: The thesis contains meticulously documented experiments (see Appendix C) but we have assigned other sections because Simson was especially talented at synthesizing scientific content for a general audience, having worked as a tech journalist and author before embarking on his PhD.

_Historical Note_: After Simson's thesis defense at MIT, many of the systems graduate students who attended questioned whether such work had enough scientific content to be worthy of a PhD.  In fact, the meticulous experimental documentation was of unusually high quality for the time.  Whereas many dissertations become quickly dated, students in prior versions of this class have consistently reported that this decades-old work contained insights that were new to them
