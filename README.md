## Course Motivation

> "Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time." \
— Gary McGraw and Edward Felten, 1999

For those of us who design, build, or deploy computing technology, the most convenient explanation for security failures is that users are to blame.  At some point in the chain of events that led to the failure, a user installed the wrong software, typed a password onto the wrong website, gave access to their data to the wrong people or the wrong programs, or made some other choice that we can, in hindsight, conclude they should not have.  If only users cared about security, took the time to [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM), and chose to be more vigilant!

A less convenient explanation is that those of us who design, build, and deploy computing technology are often ignorant about the humans these systems are meant to serve, and we often fail to write down and test our assumptions about what people must do to use these systems securely.

The field of _Usable Security_ was born when scientists started conducting human-subjects experiments to test the sometimes explicit, but more often implicit, human-factors assumptions in existing systems, starting with those in systems that were already widely deployed.  These experiments revealed that many of these assumptions were ill-conceived and that some practices thought to improve security were, in fact, harmful.

To build more secure and usable systems, with more realistic human-subjects assumptions, you will need to be able to identify and document the human-subjects assumptions within these systems.  To understand how realistic these assumptions are, you will need to be able to read and interpret existing human-subjects experiments.  When building systems with new user experiences or where human-factors assumptions have not been fully tested, you will need to be able to turn your assumption into testable hypotheses, then either test these hypotheses or work with those who will test them.  This course will prepare you to do so.

## Prerequisites

This course mostly examines many of the ubiquitous security user experience you already know through regular exposure in your day-to-day life, such as passwords, application-permissions management, sharing settings, software updates, and warning messages.  As such, there are no technical prerequisites.

The primary requirement is that students be ready to read primary-source materials (10-12 page conference and journal publications) that contain sections that they may not have the background to fully understand prior to class discussions. Its expected that students from social science backgrounds may not be familiar with the exact workings of security technologies such as public-key cryptography, whereas students with pure CS backgrounds may be initially unfamiliar with the jargon of experimental design and the presentation of statistical test results.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

1. Students will learn to examine systems to identify the explicit and implicit human-factors assumptions.
2. Students will learn to formalize hypotheses for testing these systems assumptions.
3. Students will develop skills reading research papers, evaluating their findings, and identifying their limitations.
4. Students will use these skills to build their knowledge of state-of-the-art research and experimental methods, including choosing experimental settings and statistical tests.

## Course Evaluation

  - Assignments
  - Class participation
  - Leading paper discussions
  - [Course project](/project/)

Extra credit may be given for:
  - Providing [additional help to other teams](/project/helping-others.md) beyond the minimum required under the Assignments category.
  - Submitting a [recording of your practice talk introducing the paper for discussion](/leading-paper-discussions.md).


## Collaboration Policy

We encourage studying in groups of two to four people. This applies to working on homework, discussing material, and practicing presentations. Similarly, you may consult books, publications, or online resources to help you study. However, you must always credit and acknowledge all assistance and reference materials.

At the end of the term, you may be asked to fill out a confidential survey regarding your final project team and the participation of individual members.

### Your privacy while participating

We use this public GitHub repository to list discussion leads and for students to share course projects. Contact the course instructors if you would prefer a more private option. For example, you may choose to use a pseudonym for discussion leads or share your course project materials only via more private services.


## Readings

Reading and understanding research papers is one of the fundamental skills you will develop in this course. You are expected to read and be prepared to discuss all the assigned readings.  The papers in this course have been selected to provide key background in the field and inspiration for your course projects.

**It is your responsibility to go through the syllabus and notify the instructors of which papers you would like to lead.**  You are required to lead the discussion of 2-3 papers of your choice (the exact number depends on course enrollment).  In the second half of the class, the readings in the syllabus might be replaced with other readings that serve as important background for your projects.  With instructor approval, you can substitute any of the papers in the syllabus with a paper of your choice.  The instructors might also recommend papers that they believe will be helpful or interesting to you.

Paper assignments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so we recommend selecting your papers as soon as possible.  For each paper, you should notify the instructors at least one week in advance of when you plan to present.

When it’s your turn to lead the 15-20 minute discussion of the paper, you'll want to read the guidelines on [leading paper discussions](/leading-paper-discussions.md).
