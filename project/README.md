# Course Project Guidelines

You will design a research protocol to evaluate human behaviors or attitudes that impact security or privacy in computing systems, writing up the protocol as if it were an (incomplete) research paper and presentation. (Incomplete because you may not have time to run more than a pilot study.)

Pilot any components that can be piloted in the time available, and/or use peers from other project groups to identify ways to improve your protocol. Project groups will be either 2-3 people.

The final deliverable will be a research paper which should contain:

  - **Motivation**: why the topic you chose is relevant and interesting in usable security and privacy.
  - **Research Question**: a concise statement of the question you want to answer, such as a behavior you would like to measure the prevalence of or a hypothesis that one approach to a problem is more effective than another.
  - **Related work**: a description of research that inspired yours or that your results/methodology build upon.
  (This need *not* be the size of a published paper's related work section. You don't need to read extra papers just to make this look bigger.  Cite what was important to your team as you approached this work.)
  - **Methodology**: an overview of the research method, the prepared study materials, and recruiting plan.
  - **Results** A description of the pilot sessions and the resulting changes that were made to the research materials
  - **Discussion**: interpreting the results and any implications of them.
  - **Acknowledgements**: detailing the help your team has received from those outside your project group as well as anyone else.

Be proactive about talking with the instructor before the project proposal is due in case you have chosen a topic that is out of scope or not well-scoped.

Also reach out to fellow students for feedback and help others who reach out to you.  The more helpful you are to others, the more likely it is they will help you.  (Also, helping others will help your grade, especially if [you follow the tips for how to be most helpful](./helping-others.md).

### Budget and recruiting

We have a budget of TBD/student for running studies, so you can pay participants via such services as
 - [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/)
     > A participant recruiting & payment tool.
 - [Qualtrics](https://huit.harvard.edu/qualtrics)
     > Qualtrics is a web-based application for building and conducting surveys that is free for Harvard affiliates.


### Ethics

Your course staff are deeply invested in ensuring that students learn how identify and address ethical concerns in scientific research and that course projects adhere to ethical standards of conduct.  You need to ensure the course staff has reviewed and approved the ethics section of your course proposal before you start conducting your research. You need to do your best to identify and address any possible harms, explore options for addressing them, and explain how you will proceed and what you will do if unforeseen ethical issues arise.

To do this, you will need to familiarize yourself with the [Committee on the Use of Human Subjects](https://cuhs.harvard.edu/) and their [guidelines on whether you project will require ethical review](https://cuhs.harvard.edu/do-you-need-irb-review-and-why). While most course projects are [exempt from review by CUHS](https://cuhs.harvard.edu/undergraduate-research-and-course-projects), you will still need to provide your instructors sufficient information to conduct course-level review.

Should you you want to extend your course project for publication or as a research project beyond the course, you will need to seek CUHS approval (which the course staff may be able to assist you with).  Quoting the CUHS exemption:

> Class projects and research methods classes may involve data collection activities for training purposes that do not require IRB review and oversight because the intent is to teach methods, not to contribute to generalizable knowledge. It is no longer necessary for the Course Instructor to submit an IRB application when the purpose of the class is for educational purposes only.

> However, when the primary focus and initial intent of the class activities are designed to collect data to be used by students beyond the classroom, for example for scholarly publication or use for future research, it is the responsibility of the faculty advisor to assist students in determining whether obtaining IRB approval or exemption is required and if so, that this is done prior to the initiation of a human subjects research project.

### Schedule

**You will want to get started early**, seek feedback early, pilot early, and leave time for many revisions of your study materials. In the words of a former student in this course after submitting a successful project:

> *This is tough. Every time I take another pass at this I see more things I want to change. Are the studies you work on always this iterative? How do you know when you're actually ready to deploy?*

In fact, most studies designed by researchers with decades of experience will go through more iterations than you have time for during this term, often with over a dozen iterations of test materials and two to four pilot studies. One of the things you will be learning this term is that the human-subjects studies you read are the results of lots of work you are unlikely to read about in the paper, and far more work than most people understand.

### Week 6, before class

In the breakout group projects that we started during Week 3 and presented in Week 4, I hope you all learned that:

1. Understanding the specifics of a problem is an essential first step and worth your time. (Much confusion resulted when team members didnâ€™t see the problem the same way.)

2. Different assumptions of costs and benefits can lead to different research designs.

Therefore, when you are pitching projects ideas, put 80% of your effort into writing a crisp and clear definition of the problem you want to investigate or hypothesis you wish to test, and then 20% of effort into saying which research method (survey, lab study, field study, etc.) would best apply to the problem.  We recommend starting with this [project proposal structure](/project/proposals/proposal-structure-with-examples.md) to make it easier to evaluate and compare projects.

To motivate your research, please explain the possible impact of your research on your organization or on the broader world. What decisions might be better informed by the results of your study? For example:

  - Is there a technology that you or others might choose to adopt or avoid based on the results of a study?
  - Are you identifying pain points or challenges that will help you or your organization determine which problems still need to be addressed in a design?
  - Will you be identifying users concerns so that you can better quantify them with a follow-up study so that they can be address down the road?
  - Are there benefits to the study that cannot be expressed as decisions that might be changed or resources that might be allocated differently based on the possible outcomes?

**Please submit at least two paragraphs before class**, and be prepared to answer questions about what you wrote.

### Week 7, before class

Revise your project idea by integrating any feedback you've received.

### Week 8, before class

Submit a **one-page project proposal** (10% of course grade).  You can start with the [project proposal structure](/project/proposals/proposal-structure-with-examples.md) and fill in related work, add additional questions, and provide more details about your study.

### Week 9, before class

Revise your proposal to include the following:

1. Research materials needed to execute the study:
	- study/analysis plan
	- research protocols
	- any material required during the research activities (surveys, recruiting ads, etc.)
2. Designs, mockups, and prototypes at the appropriate level of fidelity.

Share this revised proposal in the Slack channel.

Some aspects of your protocol you might want to consider:
- Where will you advertise your survey/interview protocol? What text will you use to advertise it? This text is important because it should be brief, neutral, but should spark at some interest in your study.
- What instructions will you present to your subjects? Same recommendations as above: brief, neutral and to the point. Instructions must be clear above anything else. Have them read by someone not in your group to make sure of that.
- How long will it take a subject to take your survey/interview? The question is important because that defines how much you should pay each subject, as a proportion of the current minimal wage per hour (in California, that's about $16 per hour). One question that usually emerges about this is whether you can pay more (if you have the money, of course). The answer is yes; but you should beware of paying too much because that could be coercive.
- Ethical aspects of your study design.  IRB applications often require that you do the following:
  - Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks of harm, discomforts, and hazards to the subjects and others of the research procedures. For each harm, discomfort, or hazard:
    - Describe the magnitude, probability, duration, and/or reversibility of the harm, discomfort, or hazard, AND
    - Describe how the risks will be reduced or managed
  - Consider possible physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic harms, including possible negative effects on financial standing, employability, insurability, educational advancement or reputation.


### Week 12, before class

At this point you should have run an initial pilot with at least a few convenience participants (friends or coworkers) if not a larger pilot and will want to share how this went.

### Week 14, before class

 1. Email a content-complete draft of your paper with all the required sections (see the top of this document) to the instructors.  The subject line of the email should start with "W215 Project Rough Draft".

 2. Prepare a presentation about your project for the class (see below).


### Week 14, during the class

Each group will share their project with the class. Please cover at least the following:

   * Which topic did you choose, why did you choose it, and what are the research questions?
   * Which research method did you choose, and why?
   * What material did you prepare for the study?
   * What were the results of the pilot sessions (at least 2 people) and how did the experience influence the research materials?
   * What would be your recruiting plan and target demographics if you were to continue the research?
   * What other improvements would you make to the study?

### Three days after final class

Submit the final draft of your paper.  The subject line of the email should start with "Project Final Draft".

The final draft should include any changes made following feedback from the class.  Include a copy of your study materials (survey text, interview script, etc.) in an appendix of the paper or as an email attachment.

Complete the project team assessment survey.
